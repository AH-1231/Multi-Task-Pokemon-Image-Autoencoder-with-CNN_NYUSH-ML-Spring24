# Multi-Task-Pokemon-Image-Autoencoder-with-CNN_NYUSH-ML-Spring24
Hi! This is my final project for the Spring 2024 Machine Learning course at NYU Shanghai.
The model does both image reconstruction and classification on 18,900 Pok√©mon images.
After 250 epochs:Reconstruction MSE: 13.85 Accuracy: 4.69%
Not good, but I got full marks so I stopped tuning.
Feel free to check it out or leave comments!
